Documentation (PEP 287)
For documentation compliant with PEP 287, I've added docstrings to each function, describing what they do and any exceptions they might raise. Hereâ€™s an explanation:

Docstrings: Each function has a simple docstring explaining its purpose. For divide, there's an additional note about the potential ValueError.
Code Formatting: The code adheres to PEP 8 standards with appropriate spacing, naming conventions, and line length.
Testing Docstrings: In a more formal documentation environment, you might use tools like Sphinx to generate HTML or PDF documentation from these docstrings.
This setup provides a clean, standard-compliant way to handle basic mathematical operations, test them, and document their functionality.
